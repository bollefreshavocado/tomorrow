# tomorrow

Tomorrow... this should become an application which helps all of us making tomorrow an easier and therefore a brighter day.

## Getting started

Right now you still need a local database to run this application. Later you can run it in docker containers

1. Setup mysql database on your system with a schema named "tomorrow_db" 
- the table tasks should have the columns id, content, date, priority
- the table users should have the columns id, created_at, emailadress, password, user_name
2. Start the tomorrow-API
3. Start the vue-project 
4. Go on localhost:8080 with a browser
